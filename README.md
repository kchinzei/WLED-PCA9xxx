# WLED-PCA9xxx
Private UserMod for WLED

It's a usermod of WLED using my PCA9xxxPWM. 
PCA9xxx is an I2C based PWM controller chip from NXP.
I don't have a plan to ask a pull request, because it's too much my hardware dependent.
Keeping github repository without issueing PR is not easy,
because of mixture of edited files in the original WLED files.
